# 🎓 My Last Dance at SDSU: CTF Competitions
**May 2025**

As I wrap up my senior year at San Diego State University, I’m filled with pride reflecting on the journey that brought me here—especially the challenges, wins, and late nights spent in cybersecurity competitions.

## 🧠 From Curiosity to Passion

Over the past year, I immersed myself in capture the flag (CTF) challenges that tested my skills in web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and more. Each competition pushed me beyond the classroom and taught me how to think critically, collaborate, and persevere under pressure.

## 🏆 Highlights from My Final Season

- **National Cyber League (NCL)**
  - 🥈 Ranked **73rd** nationally in the **Individual Game**
  - 🥉 Helped our team secure **20th** place in the **Team Game**

- **BugCrowd x HackTheBox Student Qualifier**
  - 💻 Ranked **19th out of 153 teams**

- **BugCrowd x HackTheBox College Rules**
  - 🎯 Placed **17th out of 63 teams**
  - 🧑‍💻 Ranked **8th Individually**

These events weren’t just technical—they were emotional, thrilling, and deeply formative.

## 💬 Final Reflections

This year was more than classes and credits—it was my last dance as an undergrad. Through these competitions, I found confidence, direction, and a network of peers who share the same passion for cybersecurity.

Now, with graduation around the corner, I'm excited to bring this energy into the professional world. The scoreboard may be reset, but the game is far from over.

*Onward.*
